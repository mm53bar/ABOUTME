# Hi, I'm Mike

This is a brief introduction to how I prefer to work as a software development manager. By writing this down, I'm hoping that you'll have a headstart in understanding how I like to work. It'll hopefully reduce your anxiety and build some trust as you get to know a bit more about me. However:

- It won't replace getting to know each other through one-on-one (1:1) meetings, day-to-day chats, etc.
- Like any documentation, this is constantly changing as my approach evolves and people like you provide me with feedback.
- It's easy to document the way I think I am but that might not be reflected in the way I act. If you see a discrepancy between this and my behaviour, please tell me. Good software is deterministic but people aren't as consistent.

By the way, I'm a [Green](https://my-personality-test.com/true-colours/green) (but also very [Orange](https://my-personality-test.com/true-colours/orange)!), an [ISTP-A](https://www.16personalities.com/istp-personality), and a [Questioner](https://quiz.gretchenrubin.com/questioner-result/).

## First up, let's talk

Communication is the foundation of effective teams. Meeting and talking helps us build a rapport. And a good rapport brings trust and respect. Once we have that, everything else gets easier.

By default, we will have a 1:1 chat every week for at least 30 minutes. These meetings are designed to give you a dedicated time and place to ask anything and everything. Don't be surprised if I encourage you to do this over a good coffee/tea/beer.

Because these meetings are about you, feel free to reschedule or cancel one if you don't have anything to talk about that week. Because we meet so regularly, missing a week doesn't have much impact. For my part, I might have to reschedule sometimes but I won't cancel a meeting.

- These meetings are for you to set the agenda. What would you like to talk about? What’s going well? What’s bugging you? How can things go even better?
- If I'm worried about your performance, I will let you know in your 1:1s. That means I won't talk to you about your performance (outside of scheduled, company-wide performance reviews) if things are going well. If you have concerns, let me know and we'll talk through it.
- I don't need to get a status report from you unless that's what you want to talk about. I'm interested in how your project is going but I'm not using this chat to make sure you're busy.
- Urgent matters should not wait for a 1:1. Don't try to book time in my calendar - just message me and I'll find time for us to chat face-to-face.
- If you ask me how to do something, don't be shocked if I don't directly answer your question. Giving you the answer doesn't help you learn. And it's not like I'm perfect either. Expect a healthy dose of [Socratic questions](https://medium.com/@federicorenzo/the-socratic-method-of-coaching-2024733626a9) in response.

## How I work

I'm a believer in servant leadership where managers work for their direct reports. Your role on the team is to ship great software that solves problems for our customers. My role on the team is to make sure you have the skills, space, context, and urgency to do that in the best possible way.

- Skills - we will have many conversations about career growth and how you want to grow your skills. I will also work to make sure that there is a skills ladder available that helps you plan your career growth.
- Space - I'm a strong believer in monotasking and focus for long periods of time. I will do my best to provide you with both of those.
- Context - you'll do a better job if you understand why you're doing it. Being busy is not the goal. I can help with that.
- Urgency - every feature we build is just a hypothesis, an idea we have that might solve a problem. The illusion of certainty tells us that we have a project when we really have an experiment. We'll find the right solutions if we validate our hypotheses sooner. Ship it!

## How I expect you to work

Working effectively in a team is about much more than just writing code. It's about having the right attitude and approach to your code and the rest of your team.

- Own your impact
  - Don't rely on others to simplify your work for you. Instead, learn their techniques so that you can be self-sufficient. Read constantly, pursuing mastery in your craft. Turning chaos into order is a large part of your value.
- Embrace change
  - Most of the cost in software is not in the development but in the maintenance. Think about reducing the cost of change while you're building a feature. This is where readability, automated testing, feature flags, design patterns, etc. are indispensable.
  - Don't be surprised when the business changes their mind after seeing your first release. This is normal. Release sooner, leverage a spike or a proof of concept project, look into paper prototypes.
- Educate over enforce
  - Resist the urge to restrict information or access. Having the information and access we need makes it faster for us to do our jobs. Even more so when there is lots of empowerment and autonomy. Slow companies build gates to control information and access. Fast companies give increased access to their people but train them to use it well.
- Prefer open communication
  - Default communication should be linkable, asynchronous, opt-in and open - opening issues, starting pull requests or publishing on a wiki/blog. Only use synchronous communication for brainstorming and feedback. This is required for remote work but also brings advantages to a co-located office.

## I Default to High Autonomy

The #1 thing to know about me is that my default management mode is to let you handle your work without much guidance or direction from me. Because of that, I may come across as aloof or disengaged. If that's a concern for you, let's talk.

- We hired you because you are smart and capable. I trust you to know your own limits and get support when needed.
- I may provide suggestions, but I will try to not force a solution.
- At the end of the day, you own the code and know more than I do about how the code works. I will trust your judgement.
- Everyone is different, and I realize some folks need more guidance than others. If you need more direction from me, please let me know as soon as possible. I will do my best to tailor the guidance I give to your experience level. If there's a mismatch in expectations then we can use our next 1:1 to get on the same page.
- I’ll get better at finding this line as we get to know each other better.

## Learning and Growing

I read a lot. Mostly articles but also books. I get most of my articles through weekly newsletters that I highly recommend you subscribe to:

- <https://softwareleadweekly.com/>
- <https://labnotes.org/>
- <https://changelog.com/>

There are a few articles that have stuck with me over time. I reference them a lot so it might be useful to read them:

- <https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/>
- <https://dannorth.net/2010/08/30/introducing-deliberate-discovery/>
- <https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html>
- <http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html>

There are a few books that have heavily impacted my approach to managing. They can be a bit boring to read if you're used to learning about coding techniques. But if you're starting to wonder about what's important to you in a workplace, these books could help you figure that out. Let's talk about them in your next 1:1.

- Turn the Ship Around, David Marquet
- Drive, Dan Pink
- Creativity Inc., Ed Catmull
- The Advantage, Patrick Lencioni

Finally, I keep an ongoing Github gist with notes, quotes, and insights that I've read and want to remember. It's always growing. You can find it at <https://gist.github.com/mm53bar/b78988ef8d968ecf6ce04e1fa36330d7>
